# React Countries App
This is a simple React app that uses the RestCountries API to display information about countries. The app allows users to filter and sort the data by various criteria.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
3. Start the development server by running npm start.

## Usage
* The app displays a list of countries, along with their region and area. The countries are sorted alphabetically by name by default. The list is paginated to display 10 countries per page.

* The user can filter the list to show only countries with an area smaller than Louisiana by clicking the "Show countries smaller than Louisiana" button. Clicking the button again will toggle the filter off and show all countries.

* The user can also sort the list by name by clicking the "Sort by name" button. Clicking the button again will toggle between ascending and descending order.

* The pagination buttons at the bottom of the list allow the user to navigate between pages.
